# Task 2 â€“ Bayesian Change Point Analysis on Brent Oil Prices

## Objective

Detect structural change points in the log returns of Brent oil prices using Bayesian statistical modeling with PyMC3.


---

## ðŸ§  Objectives

- Compute log returns from Brent oil prices.
- Detect structural break using visual inspection or statistical methods.
- Compare statistical properties (mean, std, skewness, kurtosis) before and after the change point.
- Visualize findings.

---

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

### 1. Log Return Calculation  
Using the natural logarithm of daily prices:


---

### 2. Change Point Detection  
Identify an index where a significant change in volatility or trend is observed.

---

### 3. Summary Statistics  
Calculated for both pre- and post-change point periods:

- Mean  
- Standard Deviation  
- Skewness  
- Kurtosis  

---

### 4. Visualization

- Line plot of log returns.  
- Highlighted region showing structural break.

## ðŸ“Š Results Preview

| Metric      | Before Change Point | After Change Point |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Mean        | ~0.000007           | ~0.0023            |
| Std. Dev.   | ~0.0238             | ~0.0416            |
| Skewness    | ~-0.62              | ~-4.19             |
| Kurtosis    | ~18.60              | ~103.23            |

> These results suggest a structural break leading to increased volatility in Brent oil prices.
