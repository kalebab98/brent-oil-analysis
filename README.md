# Brent Oil Price Analysis - Change Point Detection

**Birhan Energies Data Science Team**

### Project Overview

This project analyzes how major geopolitical and economic events affect Brent oil prices using Bayesian change point detection. The analysis covers 35+ years of daily oil price data (1987-2022) to identify structural breaks and correlate them with historical events.

### Business Objective

The main goal is to study how important events affect Brent oil prices, focusing on:
- Political decisions and conflicts in oil-producing regions
- Global economic sanctions
- OPEC policy changes
- Other major geopolitical events

This analysis provides insights for investors, analysts, and policymakers to better understand and react to oil price changes.

- **Event Research**: Structured dataset of 20 key geopolitical and economic events
- **Bayesian Change Point Detection**: Using PyMC3 for statistical modeling
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Flask/React dashboard for stakeholder exploration

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd W10
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run initial analysis**:
   ```bash
   python analysis_script.py
   ```

### Data Sources

- **Brent Oil Prices**: Daily prices from May 20, 1987 to September 30, 2022
- **Events Dataset**: Research-based compilation of major events affecting oil markets

### Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean Brent oil price data
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Analyze time series properties and create visualizations
3. **Event Research**: Compile structured dataset of key events
4. **Change Point Detection**: Implement Bayesian model using PyMC3
5. **Correlation Analysis**: Associate detected changes with historical events
6. **Dashboard Development**: Create interactive visualization platform

### Key Events Analyzed

The analysis includes 20 major events such as:
- Iraq-Kuwait conflict (1990-1991)
- 9/11 terrorist attacks (2001)
- Global financial crisis (2008)
- Arab Spring and Libya conflict (2011)
- OPEC production decisions (various dates)
- COVID-19 pandemic (2020)
- Russia-Ukraine war (2022)

# Task 2 â€“ Bayesian Change Point Analysis on Brent Oil Prices

## Objective

Detect structural change points in the log returns of Brent oil prices using Bayesian statistical modeling with PyMC3.


---

## ðŸ§  Objectives

- Compute log returns from Brent oil prices.
- Detect structural break using visual inspection or statistical methods.
- Compare statistical properties (mean, std, skewness, kurtosis) before and after the change point.
- Visualize findings.

---

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

### 1. Log Return Calculation  
Using the natural logarithm of daily prices:


---

### 2. Change Point Detection  
Identify an index where a significant change in volatility or trend is observed.

---

### 3. Summary Statistics  
Calculated for both pre- and post-change point periods:

- Mean  
- Standard Deviation  
- Skewness  
- Kurtosis  

---

### 4. Visualization

- Line plot of log returns.  
- Highlighted region showing structural break.

## ðŸ“Š Results Preview

| Metric      | Before Change Point | After Change Point |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Mean        | ~0.000007           | ~0.0023            |
| Std. Dev.   | ~0.0238             | ~0.0416            |
| Skewness    | ~-0.62              | ~-4.19             |
| Kurtosis    | ~18.60              | ~103.23            |

> These results suggest a structural break leading to increased volatility in Brent oil prices.

### Task-3 (Interactive Dashboard)


# Task 3 â€“ Interactive Dashboard for Brent Oil Prices and Change Point Visualization

## Objective

Develop a full-stack web application to visualize Brent oil prices, log returns, and detected change points with interactive filtering and summary statistics.

## Description

The dashboard allows users to:

- Visualize daily Brent crude oil prices and their log returns over time.
- See the Bayesian-inferred change point marked on the chart.
- Filter data by selectable date ranges.
- View descriptive statistics (mean, std dev, skewness, kurtosis) before and after the change point.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Recharts, React-Datepicker
- **Backend:** Flask with Flask-CORS for API
- **Communication:** RESTful API serving JSON data

## Backend Files

  - `/api/data` â€” Returns log returns and prices.
  - `/api/change_point` â€” Returns detected change point index.
  - `/api/summary_stats` â€” Returns descriptive statistics before/after change point.
- `log_returns.npy` â€” Shared data file.
